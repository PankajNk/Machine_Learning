# Hi folks, if ever learnt something about Machine Learning , I have a Challenge for you.
 ---> Challenge is simple solve the below question.
 ---> See the answer at last
 ---> If you finish the challenge without help of answer,
      you can DM me (saying you lose ) at https://www.linkedin.com/in/pankaj-naik-50503217a
## Here we have 5 question
### 1.Problem on Entropy
      • Consider a case of 50 student, out of which 35Passed (P) and 15 Failed (F) in the Certification Exam. Write a program to compute Entropy for the given information.
      • If we have the information that some of the candidates have undergone training and some didn’t. Based on it split the dataset, let say 20 people undergone the training 
      and 30 didn’t. Out of this 20 trained candidate 18P and 2F, while in case of 30 untrained 17P and 13F. Write a program to calculate the information gain after split of           data.
      
### 2.Project 1:
      From Data given it is required to develop the model to predict the profit of the company. Dataset filename: Companies-profit.csv
      Task:
      1) Load the dataset
      2) Analyse the data visually and give justification for selecting particular algorithm for developing the model.
      3) Split it into test and train.
      4) Develop a model for predicting the profit of the company
      5) Measure all the parameters of the model
      6) Measure the performance of the model
      
### 3.Project 2:
      • Use wine dataset from sklearn
      • Load the dataset and split it into test and train.
      • Develop the model to Classify wines into different categories.
      • Train the model using Gaussian and Multinominal classifier, please mention
        which model is better and why.
      • Use the trained model to perform some predictions on test date
### 4.Project 3:
      Datasets for Disease operation is provided. Dataset file name: Disease.csv
      1. Load the dataset and split it into test and train.
      2. Analyse the Data Visually.
      3. Find limitation with data if any in developing the model
      4. Develop the model to identify whether operation successful or not using
          Decision Tree algorithm
      5. Measure the performance of the model
      6. Try to improvise the model by suitable technique.
      7. Measure the performance of the model
 ### 5. Project 4:
      Use iris flower dataset from sklearn library and try to form clusters of flowers
      using petal width and length features.
      • Analyse the Data Visually before training
      • Drop other two features for simplicity.
      • Try to Use K Mean Clustering
      • Analyse the Data Visually by comparing before and after the training.
